# delivery_time_prediction
**Problem Statement:**
The objective of this assignment is to build a regression model that predicts the delivery time 
for orders placed through Porter. The model will use various features such as the items ordered, 
the restaurant location, the order protocol, and the availability of delivery partners. 
The key goals are:
• Predict the delivery time for an order based on multiple input features

• Improve delivery time predictions to optimize operational efficiency 

• Understand the key factors influencing delivery time to enhance the model's accuracy

**Tasks Performed:**
a) Load the data
b) Data preprocessing and Feature Engineering
c) Exploratory Data Analysis
d) Model Building
e) Results and Inferences

**Conclusion:**
a)	total_outstanding_orders has the highest impact on the target variable/
b)	total_onshift_dashers and distance have the significant impact on the model
c)	Outlier handling improved the overall model performance.
